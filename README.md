## 1. Chat with AI
[Main] ---> [Network] ---> [Oasis] ---> [Chat with AI]
<img width="940" height="447" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e264254-1c3f-4a66-80ad-833145b7421a" /> 
When chatting with AI for the first time, you can choose what topics to talk about. These options can be freely added or removed by the user in the System Message tab.  
<img width="940" height="447" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/858c0e13-fee5-46d1-9da0-37ab30879bd4" />  
When a chat with AI begins, it is given a title and displayed in the chat list on the left side.
"Users can continue chatting with AI, and if there is chat data from the past, they can select it to resume the conversation.
<img width="943" height="440" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fcd1d52-a875-4c53-835a-bc1c9a157d7a" />  
Chat data can be renamed, exported, or deleted.
<img width="938" height="446" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/283debb0-638e-4b1e-b58c-4eb770899b15" />  

## Ask OpenWrt Setting (Basic Usage)
Oasis is customizing the AI to specialize in OpenWrt. Therefore, it may prompt users to ask about OpenWrt. If a user requests configuration related to OpenWrt, the AI will suggest changes using UCI commands.  
<img width="946" height="443" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf4ad521-5b90-4a95-a847-a7d870413499" />
When a configuration change is suggested by the AI using UCI commands, the internal system of OpenWrt recognizes that a configuration change has been proposed by the AI. It then notifies the user via a popup to apply the configuration change to the current runtime. The user can accept the configuration change by pressing the Apply button.ã€€ã€€ 
<img width="944" height="443" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a52798c-2887-41ec-b151-bed95f01d1c5" />
<img width="947" height="444" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9d2b1a7-d4d9-4471-b81b-80ef2c7e700e" /> 
After applying the settings, if the user can access the WebUI, they will be notified in the Oasis chat screen to finalize the configuration change suggested by the AI. The user can press the Finalize button to approve the configuration change, or press the Rollback button to reject it.ã€€ã€€
<img width="946" height="442" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b69221e9-856d-47f8-ad1e-af879ae558e0" />
 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> After a configuration change, if the user does not press the Finalize or Rollback button within 5 minutes (default), the configuration will automatically rollback (Rollback monitoring). This ensures that even if there was a configuration error that caused a brick, the system will return to the original, normal settings. Note: If the OpenWrt device is powered off during the rollback monitoring period, the rollback monitoring will resume upon restart.

## Ask OpenWrt Setting (Advanced Usage)
> [!NOTE]
> The following is an effective usage method when using high-performance LLMs such as OpenAI.

If you are willing to provide your current settings to the AI, you can select UCI Config from the dropdown menu below the message box. When you provide this as supplementary information when making a request to the AI, the accuracy of its suggestions will improve significantly. For example, as shown in the following case.

In the following example, Wi-Fi is enabled, and when requesting some configuration changes, the current wireless settings are provided to the AI as reference information.
<img width="1887" height="881" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/167c2691-c5d6-4b4c-88a1-3a82a96bb6ca" />  
When you send a message to the AI, the selected configuration information (e.g., wireless settings) will be added at the bottom.  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> After pressing the Send button, select ```OpenWrt Teacher (for High-Performance LLM)``` from the list of system messages displayed.
<img width="946" height="443" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8ea11d1-e6fa-4c9b-9982-b1dbfdc7bfcd" />  

By providing the current configuration information, the accuracy of the AI's suggestions improves.  
<img width="946" height="445" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/baa28d6d-2c5b-4082-a780-dcf4e80c120e" />  
<img width="944" height="449" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7dae99a1-8fad-4b6a-a55e-efc3f719ef2d" />  
<img width="947" height="443" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fd37066-4ab3-4534-ae42-18ec6540f94e" /> 

## Rollback Data List
AI-driven configuration changes are saved as rollback data, allowing users to revert settings to any desired point.
<img width="944" height="444" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f65108a-674e-435b-824d-69933e70d80e" />ã€€ã€€  

## System Message (Knowledge)
In Oasis, users can create and save system messages to use when starting a chat with AI. System messages are preloaded data used by AI to respond to the user.
For example, add a message like the following as a system message to instruct the AI to interpret English and Japanese.
<img width="954" height="440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1415cb9a-198f-47e7-8921-a963516a1772" />  
Enter the instructions for the AI into the text area of 'Create System Message' and press the Add button to add it to the System Message List. This will register a new System Message called 'Translator.'
<img width="932" height="430" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4108e2c0-d439-4bb6-8937-0ffd787a869d" />  
When you return to the Chat with AI tab and start a new chat with the AI, 'Translator' will appear as a topic option.
<img width="936" height="446" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/001aa57f-9cb9-4299-b0a9-4ab73288079a" />  
When 'Translator' is selected, the user's English message will be translated into Japanese by the AI.
<img width="934" height="447" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d3ddcc5-5e43-4c55-bcb0-67b6467e71af" />  
In this way, by including instructions or specific knowledge for the AI as system messages, it is possible to modify the AI's behavior toward users.
Currently, Oasis adjusts responses related to OpenWrt solely through system messages.
As a result, by storing information about OpenWrt settings as knowledge in existing or new system messages, it will become specialized in modifying OpenWrt settings.
In particular, Oasis analyzes whether content related to modifying OpenWrt settings (UCI command sequences) found within AI responses can be executed. Then, it notifies the user with a popup.

## Oasis Local Tool(OLT) Server
By installing oasis-mod-tool, an extension module for Oasis, the AI will be able to use the tools. After installation, you can optionally enable AI tools from the Tools tab.  
<img width="935" height="443" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c13d8c5-1da3-4c06-842b-13481226863b" />  
The following is an example with both get_ip_addr and get_ifname_list enabled.  
<img width="941" height="428" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/584c41bd-718b-46f5-9dab-cda7379d0362" />  
By enabling the tools, the AI will begin using them in response to user requests.  
<img width="934" height="446" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82944040-30f8-44ef-82bd-67b9a9157f4a" />  
You can add Oasis tools as plugins, giving you the freedom to let the AI use whichever tools you prefer.
Building your own tools is easy, too.
For more information, check out the repository below.

https://github.com/utakamo/oasis-tool-box  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature requires that the AI supports tool usage. OpenAI's AI can use tools.
> However, when using Ollama, some AIs may not support tool usage.
> For details on which Ollama AIs support tools, please refer to the URL below.

# Oasis RPC (json-rpc2.0)
Dependency Package: `uhttpd-mod-ubus`
> [!NOTE]
> If you wish to use this functionality, you may need to install uhttpd-mod-ubus.
> ```
> root@OpenWrt~# opkg update
> root@OpenWrt~# opkg install uhttpd-mod-ubus
> ```

Oasis supports RPC functionality.  
If you want to use the RPC feature, please check the RPC radio button on the Oasis settings page.
<img width="747" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1829e60d-a420-45e7-962e-5dbc03787036" />

The following is an example of message request and response exchange utilizing Oasis's RPC function. The assumed router credentials are as follows:  
- Username: `root`
- Password: `12345678`
- OpenWrt Device Ip address: `192.168.1.1/24`  

## 1. Create ubus rpc session id
- [Request]  
`
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "call", "params": [ "00000000000000000000000000000000", "session", "login", { "username": "root", "password": "12345678"  } ] }'  http://192.168.1.1/ubus
`  
- [Response (Example)]  
`
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":[0,{"ubus_rpc_session":"3cc578e5bc9f2b032c6445ea5696c9c8","timeout":300,"expires":299, ... 
`

The ubus_rpc_session in this response will be used for sending subsequent requests. In this example, the ubus_rpc_session is `3cc578e5bc9f2b032c6445ea5696c9c8`, so this number is used in the next request submission example.

## 2. Get base infomation for ai chat
- [Request]  
`
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "call", "params": [ "3cc578e5bc9f2b032c6445ea5696c9c8", "oasis", "base_info", {} ] }'  http://192.168.1.1/ubus
`  
- [Response (Example)]  
`
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":[0,{"sysmsg":[{"key":"default","title":"OpenWrt Teacher (for High-Performance LLM)"},{"key":"custom_1","title":"OpenWrt System Knowledge (Sample)"},{"key":"custom_2","title":"OpenWrt Network Knowledge (Sample)"}],"configs":["dhcp","dropbear","firewall","luci","network","system","ubihealthd","uhttpd","wireless"],"service":[{"identifier":"1270318202","name":"OpenAI","model":"gpt-4"},{"identifier":"5336525023","name":"Ollama","model":"gemma2:2b"}],"icon":{"list":{"icon_1":"openwrt.png","icon_2":"operator.png"},"ctrl":{"using":"icon_1","path":"/www/luci-static/resources/oasis/"}},"chat":{"item":[{"id":"1873851023","title":"UIThemeChange"},{"id":"3598688228","title":"OpenWrtUIThemeChanges"},{"id":"6053520290","title":"\"ConfiguringWi-FiSettingsinOpenWrt\""},{"id":"3850114087","title":"\"GuidetoBasicOpenWrtNetworkandWi-FiSettingsUsingUCICommands\""}]}}]}
`

By sending and receiving the above request and response, you obtain the basic information needed to start the chat. The basic information includes system messages (knowledge) and corresponding keys, which can be properly specified in the fields for chat message requests explained next, allowing you to send messages to the AI.

## 3. Send user message (Initial conversation)
- [Request]  
`
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "call", "params": [ "3cc578e5bc9f2b032c6445ea5696c9c8", "oasis.chat", "send", {"id": "", "sysmsg_key": "default", "message": "Hello!!"} ] }'  http://192.168.1.1/ubus
`  
- [Response (Example)]  
`
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":[0,{"id":"6441905234","uci_parse_tbl":{"status":"No Parsing ..."},"content":"Hello! How can I assist you with OpenWrt today?","title":"\"OpenWrtAssistanceSessionIntroduction\""}]}
`  

The AI's response in the initial conversation includes a chat ID (Ex: `6441905234`). To continue the conversation, you need to include this chat ID when sending a message."

## 4. Send user message (Subsequent conversations)
- [Request]
`
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "call", "params": [ "c5b484940761463117b0ab5d4a6105e7", "oasis.chat", "send", {"id": "6441905234", "sysmsg_key": "default", "message": "Please change the hostname to utakamo.
"} ] }'  http://192.168.1.1/ubus
`
- [Response (Example)]  
`
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":[0,{"content":"Sure, you can change the hostname to 'utakamo' using the UCI command. Here are the steps you need to follow:\n\n1. Open a terminal.\n\n2. Enter the following command:\n\n```bash\nuci set system.@system[0].hostname='utakamo'\n```\n\nNow, your system's hostname should be updated to 'utakamo'. Please let me know if you have any other questions or tasks!","uci_parse_tbl":{"uci_notify":true,"uci_list":{"delete":[],"set":[{"class":{"option":"hostname","config":"system","value":"'utakamo'","section":"@system[0]"},"param":"system.@system[0].hostname='utakamo'"}],"del_list":[],"reorder":[],"add_list":[],"add":[]}}}]}
